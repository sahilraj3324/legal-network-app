Placeholder file for onboarding images.

To add actual images for the onboarding screens, place the following files in this directory:

1. onboarding1.png - For the first onboarding screen (Welcome to Legal Network)
2. onboarding2.png - For the second onboarding screen (Manage Cases Efficiently)
3. onboarding3.png - For the third onboarding screen (Connect with Professionals)

Recommended image specifications:
- Format: PNG or JPEG
- Size: 300x200 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- Content: Legal-themed illustrations or icons
- Style: Professional, clean, and modern

For now, the app will show placeholder containers with instructions until actual images are added.
